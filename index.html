            <p><h4>Do your research on the movers before you hire them</h4></p>
            <section>
                <p>If they are scammers or simply not professional enough, you will end up spending a lot more money then you planned. So, what you should do, besides the online research, is to <b>ask them in person for referrals</b>, if you are not sure about are they a <a href="https://www.moving.com/tips/how-to-choose-a-moving-company-in-7-steps/"> reliable moving company</a>. This will show them that you mean business and that you are a serious customer. Even if they are a reliable company that had no intention of scamming you, this may still nudge them into giving you a sweeter deal if they will that you are not really convinced.</p>

                <h3>Here are some direct tactics to get the best deal with movers</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <p><li><i>Ask them for a discount</i> – While this may seem too obvious, there is usually nothing better to ask for something if you want it. So, do not be ashamed of asking for a discount.</li></p>
                    <p><li><i>Prepare arguments for it</i> – If you are going to ask for a discount, it’s best to have a reason or two prepared. One of them could be the fact that you are really flexible with the moving schedule. This could mean a lot to them if you are moving during the summer because that is when they are busiest.</li></p>
                    <p><li><i>Think about the package</i> – A lot of moving companies offer various services. Make sure that you know all the details of what you are signing up for. Maybe you can do a portion of that one service that you are interested in. If that is the case, it may be a way to save some money by negotiating a lower price.</li></p>
